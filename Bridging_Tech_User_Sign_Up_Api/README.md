Bridging Tech: User Sign-Up API for K-12 Educational Platform - Code Sample
Overview
This document provides an overview of the API endpoint I developed for Bridging Tech, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing laptops to youth experiencing housing insecurity. The goal of the Bridging Tech Ed platform is to teach school-aged children how to effectively use computers and the internet.

Code Contribution
The contribution highlighted in this code sample focuses on the user sign-up API endpoint, which handles user registration within the application. This functionality includes processing POST requests from the frontend, validating and storing user information, and generating a corresponding points history record in the database.

Key Features
User Information Validation: The API checks for existing usernames and emails to ensure they are unique, providing clear feedback if they are already in use.
Secure Password Handling: User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
Parental Consent Management: The endpoint supports collecting parental consent for users under a certain age, with logic that distinguishes between parent and user emails based on age.
Database Interaction: Upon successful user creation, a new row is automatically generated in the users_points_history table to track user engagement and rewards within the platform.
Data Formatting: The API handles date formatting to ensure compatibility with PostgreSQL, converting user-provided date of birth data into the correct format.
API Endpoint
Endpoint: /api/signup
Method: POST
Response: Returns a status code and message indicating the success or failure of the user creation process.
Sample Workflow
User Registration: When a new user submits their registration form, the API validates the provided data, ensuring unique usernames and emails.
Password Security: The password is hashed before storage.
Parental Email Handling: If the user is under 13, the system checks for and stores the parentâ€™s email.
Database Update: The API creates a new user record in the users table, along with a corresponding entry in the users_points_history table.
Response: The API returns a confirmation message if the user was successfully created, or an error message if the process failed.
